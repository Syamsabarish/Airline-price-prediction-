# Airline-price-prediction-
**Project Overview**:
  This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data and building a machine learning model to predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, journey date, source, destination, route, duration, and number of stops.
  The dataset contains flight details for domestic Indian airlines and is suitable for EDA, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

**Technologies Used**:
  Python
  Pandas & NumPy
  Matplotlib & Seaborn
  Scikit-learn
  Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning Models
